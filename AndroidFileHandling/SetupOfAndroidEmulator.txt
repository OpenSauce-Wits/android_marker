Download Android studio and open the AVD Manager
Select Nexus 5x and install the emulator and it's image(R)
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/emulator-linux-6466327.zip
260 mb

get a system image (oreo)
https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sys-img/google_apis_playstore/x86-26_r07.zip
750 mb

after installing these, go to your sdk folder then go into the emulator folder.

run "./emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_26 -no-window -no-audio -no-skin"

It might give you an error saying "This user doesn't have permissions to use KVM."
The solution can be found on this website: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42814538/android-studio-2-3-using-emulator-from-console-dev-kvm-device-permission-den"

Just simply run these commands:]

"Simply try this. this was work for me

$ sudo chown username -R /dev/kvm

sometimes you need to run this code also

$ cd Android/Sdk/emulator/lib64/libstdc++
$ mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.bak
$ ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6"

run "./emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_26 -no-window -no-audio -no-skin"
To run the headless emulator.
To get the name of the emulator run adb devices. It should be listed.

the last thing to do now is run the MarkProject.sh script and you are done

this should run the tests and return a reports file

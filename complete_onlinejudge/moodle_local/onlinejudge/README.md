Introduction
============

The Online Judge 3 plugin for Moodle 3 (there are older versions) is designed for courses involving programming.
It can automatically grade submitted source code by testing them against customizable
test cases (ACM-ICPC/Online Judge style).

It contains three modules:

1. *judgelib* - a local-type plugin which provides an online judge function library to any part
   of Moodle.
2. *judges* - judge engine plugins for judgelib.
3. *clients* - any kind of moodle plugins can work as the client of judgelib to provide UI
   to teachers and students and call the judgelib to judge submissions. 

Now, this plugin includes two judge engines:

1. *sandbox* compiles and executes C/C++ programs locally in a protected environment. Supports **Linux 32/64-bit** only.
2. *sphere_engine* posts all data to sphere-engine.com which compiles and executes programs remotely. Supports 40+ languaes, such as C/C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Perl, PHP. Works in both Windows and Linux.
3. *docker* posts all data to docker image which compilers, executes, and limiting their behavior. *(Under Development)*

Now, this plugin includes one client:

1. Online Judge Assignment Feedback Plugin - online judge version of the official *feedback plugin* assignment activity.

The workflow is:

1. Administrators install and config it.
2. Teachers create *Assignment*, choose *Online Judge* as a feedback type, and setup *testcases*, etc.
3. Students submit code in Online Judge Assignment Activities.
4. The judge daemon judges the submissions in background.
5. Teachers and students get judge results in Online Judge Assignment Activities.

# android_marker
A moodle extension/plugin for marking student's android apps.

## In Conjunction with Android CLI

# The Rationale 
Let's assume student A writes some logic code
Lecturer B will create his own activity and create test cases
B will upload project files for A to develop, however will remove test cases.
***
The Program assumes that A has already submitted his logic

> The program will copy the contents of the logic code and save over B's file.


## Run the program
`./compile.sh Calculator`

## Contents

* Android Calculator Code (src)
* Android Unit Test (Project B)
